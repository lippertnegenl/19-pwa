# 19-pwa
19-pwa

I found this homework especially difficult because we had to code for the front end and the back end and make them work synchronously.  If any scripts or routes were wrong it wouldn't work.  I liked and disliked working on the pwa homework.  I liked it because it was full stack we got to setup the backend and the frontend and now I finally understood how they work together.  I disliked it because I could not get my webpage to deploy after doing the code.  After several hours of troubleshooting errors I still could not get it to deploy.  According to the grading rubric the deployment is worth 32% of the grade which I will have to forefeit if I want any grade at all.  I really wish I could have a solved version of this homework to reference for preparing for the real world.  I think it would be very advantageous.  I will continue to look for a solution to my deployment problem after I have turned this in as I think it is a great examply of how a full stack PWA works and will help me prepare for a job.  In the mean time I need a grade and will be turning it in incomplete.
